LoxOS 0.2
LoxOS is a lightweight, 16-bit real mode operating system crafted entirely in x86 Assembly. Designed for educational purposes, hobby OS development, and showcasing BIOS-level interactions, it offers a minimal yet functional command-line interface with essential commands like help, clear, cpuid, info, and mem.

üîß Features
Pure x86 Assembly: Built from the ground up for low-level control.
Command-Line Interface: Supports input buffering and backspace functionality.
CPUID Handling: Retrieves processor name, vendor, and logical core count.
RAM Detection: Uses BIOS interrupt 0x12 to report available memory.
Built-in Commands:
help: Lists all available commands.
clear: Clears the screen for a fresh view.
cpuid: Displays CPU vendor and name.
mem: Shows available RAM size.
info: Presents an OS information table.
Custom BIOS Bootloader: Loads the kernel directly from disk.
Text Output: Leverages BIOS interrupt 0x10 for display.
Graphic Mode: Initializes 320x200, 256-color mode (0x13), ready for future use.
üñ• System Requirements
Hardware: x86-based PC or emulator (e.g., QEMU, Bochs, VirtualBox).
Assembler: NASM (Netwide Assembler).
Storage: 1.44MB floppy disk image or bootable USB for real hardware.
üõ† Build & Run
1Ô∏è‚É£ Assemble the Code
Run the following commands to build and launch LoxOS:

bash

–ö–æ–ø–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å
